<body>
    <p>I am a self-taught web developer with a background in film editing and business English teaching. 
    My transition into web development reflects my passion for technology and creative problem-solving. 
    Proficient in front-end and back-end technologies, I excel at translating ideas into visually appealing and 
    functional websites. My experience in film taught me storytelling and meeting deadlines, 
    while teaching honed my communication skills. I'm committed to staying updated with industry trends 
    and delivering high-quality results. I aim to leverage my diverse background to create exceptional web experiences 
    and contribute effectively to dynamic teams.</p>
